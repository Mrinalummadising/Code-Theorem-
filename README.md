#### Requirements:

 - Translate figma designs into clean HTML/CSS layouts.

-  Ensure responsive and accessible designs across devices.  

-  UI need to match the figma design given below.


### Step 1: Analyze the Figma Design

- Take a close look at the Figma design.
- Identify the different elements: headers, cards, tables, sidebars, etc.
- Note down the colors, fonts, and sizes used.

### Step 2: Plan the Layout Structure

- Sketch a rough outline of the page layout on paper or in a note-taking app.
- Decide which HTML elements will be used for each part (e.g., `<nav>` for navigation, `<header>` for the top bar).
- Determine the structure of the document: where the `<header>`, `<aside>`, `<main>`, and `<footer>` tags will go.

### Step 3: Write the Basic HTML

- Start with a basic HTML5 template.
- Break down your layout sketch into HTML sections.
- Add the elements without styling: just focus on getting the content into the HTML.

### Step 4: Add CSS Styling

- Start with global styles (fonts, colors).
- Style each section of the page according to the design (header, sidebar, main content).

### Step 5: Make the Design Responsive

- Use media queries to adjust the design for different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop).
- Make sure elements stack or resize depending on the screen width.

### Step 6: Add Interactivity (if applicable)

- Implement hover effects for buttons and links.
- Add any JavaScript for interactive components if required (like dropdowns, modals).

### Step 7: Test Your Page

- Test the layout in different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari).
- Test on different devices to ensure the layout is responsive.
- Use browser developer tools to test and tweak.

### Step 8: Check Accessibility

- Make sure text is readable and has sufficient contrast.
- Test the site with keyboard navigation.
- Use online tools to check for accessibility compliance.

### Step 9: Optional Features (for Bonus Points)

- Implement more complex responsive features like off-canvas menus or collapsible sidebars.
- Add animations or transitions for a better user experience.
